<h2>Background Context</h2>
<li>In this project, you learn different caching algorithms.

<h2>Resources</h2>
<h2>Read or watch:</h2>

<li>Cache replacement policies - FIFO
<li>Cache replacement policies - LIFO
<li>Cache replacement policies - LRU
<li>Cache replacement policies - MRU
<li>Cache replacement policies - LFU
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<li>At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

<h2>General</h2>
<li>What a caching system is
<li>What FIFO means
<li>What LIFO means
<li>What LRU means
<li>What MRU means
<li>What LFU means
<li>What the purpose of a caching system
<li>What limits a caching system have
<h2>Requirements</h2>
Python Scripts
<li>All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
<li>All your files should end with a new line
<li>The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
<li>A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
<li>Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
<li>All your files must be executable
<li>The length of your files will be tested using wc
<li>All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
<li>All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
<li>All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
<li>A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
